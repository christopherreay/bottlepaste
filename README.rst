bottlepaste
-----------

A command line pastebin akin to `sprunge.us <http://sprunge.us/>`_ but using
`bottle.py <http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/bottle.py>`_.

The author deploys it on `cloudControl <https://www.cloudcontrol.com/>`_ as:
`bottlepaste <http://bottlepaste.cloudcontrolled.com/>`_

Stability
---------

This software is in alpha stage. Don't depend in any way on the links.

Deployment
----------

The cloudControl specific customizations and files  are stored in the
``custom`` branch. When deploying, the ``custom`` branch is rebased onto the
local master, then pushed to ``master`` on the remote side and then deployed as
the ``default`` deployment. See the ``magic.sh`` script for how it's done.
Incidentally, since cloudControl uses ``buildpacks`` you *should* be able tp
deploy this app to heroku too.
